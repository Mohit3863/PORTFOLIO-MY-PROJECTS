        In the social sciences, coding is an analytical process in which data,
        in both quantitative form (such as questionnaires results) or
        qualitative form (such as interview transcripts) are categorized to
        facilitate analysis. One purpose of coding is to transform the data into
        a form suitable for computer-aided analysis. This categorization of
        information is an important step, for example, in preparing data for
        computer processing with statistical software. Prior to coding, an
        annotation scheme is defined. It consists of codes or tags. During
        coding, coders manually add codes into data where required features are
        identified. The coding scheme ensures that the codes are added
        consistently across the data set and allows for verification of
        previously tagged data.[1] Some studies will employ multiple coders
        working independently on the same data. This also minimizes the chance
        of errors from coding and is believed to increase the reliability of
        data. Directive One code should apply to only one category and
        categories should be comprehensive. There should be clear guidelines for
        coders (individuals who do the coding) so that code is consistent.
        Quantitative approach For quantitative analysis, data is coded usually
        into measured and recorded as nominal or ordinal variables.
        Questionnaire data can be pre-coded (process of assigning codes to
        expected answers on designed questionnaire), field-coded (process of
        assigning codes as soon as data is available, usually during fieldwork),
        post-coded (coding of open questions on completed questionnaires) or
        office-coded (done after fieldwork). Note that some of the above are not
        mutually exclusive. In social sciences, spreadsheets such as Excel and
        more advanced software packages such as R, Matlab, PSPP/SPSS, DAP/SAS,
        MiniTab and Stata are often used. Qualitative approach For disciplines
        in which a qualitative format is preferential, including ethnography,
        humanistic geography or phenomenological psychology a varied approach to
        coding can be applied. Iain Hay (2005) outlines a two-step process
        beginning with basic coding in order to distinguish overall themes,
        followed by a more in depth, interpretive code in which more specific
        trends and patterns can be interpreted.[2] Much of qualitative coding
        can be attributed to either grounded or a priori coding.[3] Grounded
        coding refers to allowing notable themes and patterns emerge from the
        document themselves, where as a priori coding requires the researcher to
        apply pre-existing theoretical frameworks to analyze the documents. As
        coding methods are applied across various texts, the researcher is able
        to apply axial coding, which is the process of selecting core thematic
        categories present in several documents to discover common patterns and
        relations.[4] Coding is considered a process of discovery and is done in
        cycles. Prior to constructing categories, a researcher might apply a
        first and second cycle coding methods.[3] There are a multitude of
        methods available, and a researcher will want to pick one that is suited
        for the format and nature of their documents. Not all methods can be
        applied to every type of document. Some examples of first cycle coding
